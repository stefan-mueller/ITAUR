### Objectives

This workshop covers how to perform common text analysis and natural language processing tasks using R.  Contrary to a belief popular among some data scientists, when used properly, R is a fast and powerful tool for managing even very large text analysis tasks.  

The course comprises six mini "modules", each consisting of guided instruction in the form of presentation of methods followed by student implementation of those methods prior to advancing to the next module. Only after we have completed the practical exercises will we advance to the next stage.  

We will cover how to format and input source texts, how to structure their metadata, and how to prepare them for analysis.  This includes common tasks such as tokenisation, including constructing ngrams and "skip-grams", removing stopwords, stemming words, and other forms of feature selection.  We show how to: get summary statistics from text, search for and analyse keywords and phrases, analyse text for lexical diversity and readability,  detect collocations, apply dictionaries, and measure term and document associations using distance measures.  Our analysis covers basic text-related data processing in the R base language, but most relies on the **quanteda** package  (https://github.com/kbenoit/quanteda) for the quantitative analysis of textual data.  We also cover how to pass the structured objects from quanteda into other text analytic packages for doing topic modelling, latent semantic analysis, regression models, and other forms of machine learning.

### Prerequisites

While it is designed for those who have used R in some form previously, expertise in R is not required, and even those with no previous knowledge of R are welcome.

### Reading materials

    - Make sure you have at least R 3.3.3 installed.  Recommended is the latest version of R, as of 27 April 2017, is 3.4.0.
    - Make sure your packages are up-to-date.  From the command line, run
        ```r
        update.packages(ask = FALSE)
        ```
    - Install **quanteda** from CRAN.  From the "Packages" pane in RStudio, or from the command line:

### Module 7: Tell us about your problems

*  This session is intended for students to describe their own challenges and for the instructors to describe how to solve them.  If you have some data you'd like us to work on live, as part of our interactive answers to your problems, you are encouraged to put them somewhere that can be accessed online, so that we will be able to access them in the class.  Feel free to file issues at https://github.com/kbenoit/ITAUR/issues or even [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), [make a change, and issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) to correct it!
